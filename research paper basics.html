how to use google scholar ( bibliographic database for peer reviewd article) :
  <br>  search : keyword
 <br>   a and b (shows mention of both)
 <br>   a or b ( shows mention of one or other and both as well )

<p>  see latest research : see date

 <p>   look for citations of paper you are interested in : 
 <br>   use :  cited by
  tip : you can use cited by to understand complex papers 
 
 <p>   and then see relevant papers in reference section of cited paper

 <br>   collect papers that you want to cite  

<p>  how to search for research paper :
<br>1) decide on important and relevant keywords ( take help of keyword suggested by database ) (example insulin , obesity , children) ( make list)
<br>2)  word* :shows everything having word  'word' in it
<br>3)   use 'AND' or 'OR' and you can use ()
<br>4) you can use 'NOT'
<br>5) use word 'NEAR' like : insuline NEAR resistance -> will give paper where insulin and resistance are talked about
<br>6)create search alert 
<br>7)look for recent papers 
<br>8)use filters
<br>9)ask teacher for paper reccomendation 
<br>10)take idea from similar articles to know you are in right field 
<br>11)use 'cited by'

<p>how to read research paper :
<br>1) preview the text 
  <br> abstract 
<br>   title
<br>   authors
 <br>  gain first ideas or assumptions 
<br>2)annotate
<br>   1) use margin as memory triggers 
<br>   2)use symbol system : simlle and defined by you to mark : like asterick for something that you find surprizing , trinagle for doubt and so on
 <br>  3)ask questions to self , list them and try to read paper through them
<br>3)outline, summarise and anlyse
 <br>    outline ( discover skeleton)
  <br>    - in one sentence
  <br>   summarise 
  <br>   - paper in few sentences or a paragraph
  <br>   analyse 
  <br>   - arguement was weak or strong , any other way possible to do/assert same , analsyis  
<br>4)look for patterns / repetetions
 <br>   recognise tone of the text
  <br>  -choice of words, examples given, phrases , authors's significanes   
<br>5)contexualise 
  <br>  review in multiple perspective ,think of same thing in different perspectives
    how it is framed by historic, cultural or intellectual circumstance 
   reflect and build your own experience 
<br>6)compare and contrast  
<br>    main themes of paper (compare different paper in same theme) 
   <br> main : find gaps you can fill 
    make connection between different things 

<p>reading effectively :
<br>  abstract to title relation ( what gap the paper is trying to fill)
<br>  use introduction to see how they reached their problem statement
<br>  subsection headlines of results , mark pictorial or other vizualizations of result crux, key results 
<br>  use conclusion to see how their paper fits in research space and literature 
<br>  look their critical citation , papers based on which their research is built mainly
<br>  mark for more deeper dive or not so : for future deepening into paper 

<p>methodologies tools and literature review:
 <br>- you build a map or topology of the research space and show in which gap or place your research fits ( answered questions etc.)
 <br>- backgroud: as general as possible 
<br> - narrower categories : review becomes critical
<br> - focus : for uncovering gaps 
<br> - hypothesis : where you reach out of all analysis and review
<br>be selective : dicernment but substancial : substance 

<p>types of research questions :
<br>1) descriptive : like a survey
<br>2)comparative : causation or correlation 
<br>3) experimental : take variables and variate around them or with them
<br>4)historical : events , how , when  leading history 

<p>structure of lit review :
<br>take recent research paper and see how they wrote their review 
<br>-chronological order ( order of time,events )
<br>-school of thought ( point of views) 
<br>-boundaries of research ( venn diagram) ( venn diagrams of sucject/topics in whic your area lies)  
<br>narrow and micro streamlining ( you may go backward to reverse engineer topics )
